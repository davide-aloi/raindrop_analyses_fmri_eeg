Rodi's preprocessing pipeline
Ok. I can tell you very quickly the order I use:

1) filtering of the whole raw data (not epoched, to avoid edge artefacts)
2) epoch the data
3) visual inspection to detect bad channels and trials + excluding these from the data
4) ICA (runica from eeglab)
5) visual inspection of components and removing of blinks and horizontal eye movements
6) check data again if it's clean
7) re-referencing to average
8) interpolation of bad channels
